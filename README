The file INSTALL in this very same directory describes how to setup & use BEINC


What is BEINC?
--------------

Blackmore's Enchanced IRC Notification Collection (BEINC) is a free set of
components that aim to provide a complete system for different on-screen-display
notification scenarios.

The current version of BEINC contains the following components:
beinc_server.py - server used for queueing or providing on-screen-display (OSD)
beinc_poller.py - client used to fetch enqueued messages from beinc_server.py
                  and provide OSD
beinc_weechat.py - a complete script / client for the Weechat IRC client >=0.4.0
                   used to push notification messages to beinc_server.py
beinc_generic_client.py - a simple client used to push notification messages
                          to beinc_server.py
                          Its main purpose is to provide a convenient way to 
                          test beinc_server.py (and beinc_poller.py) as well as
                          to serve as an example on how to develop BEINC-clients
